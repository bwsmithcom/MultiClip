# MultiClip

MultiClip allows you to store multiple clipboard options 
in slots 1 - 12. 

When you are using another application, simple select 
""Ctrl-F1"" to put Clip #1 into your clipboard.

The other clipboard slots work the same, just replace F1
with the slot you would like to copy, 5 is F5.

You can then paste this clip into your application using the
standard ""Ctrl-v"" command.
